## Melee Frame Data
This project was made as an exercise for me to get more experience learning React.js. I wanted to compile all of the available frame data for each character in Super Smash Bros. Melee into one clean interface. Over time, I will be adding new features to expand on this project. Enjoy!

## Technologies used
I began this project using Facebookincubator which you can check out [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
I also wanted to implement Bootstrap into my project which led me to use [Reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap).
